## üõ°Ô∏è Introduction  

This project demonstrates the construction of a **honeynet** in Azure, coupled with a **Log Analytics workspace** to monitor and analyze live traffic. Using **Microsoft Sentinel**, I developed attack maps, activated alerts, and generated incidents. The key objectives included:  

- Assessing security metrics in an insecure environment over 24 hours.  
- Implementing security controls and reevaluating metrics for an additional 24 hours.  

**Highlighted Metrics:**  
- `SecurityEvent`: Windows Event Logs  
- `Syslog`: Linux Event Logs  
- `SecurityAlert`: Log Analytics Alerts Triggered  
- `SecurityIncident`: Incidents created by Sentinel  
- `AzureNetworkAnalytics_CL`: Malicious Flows allowed into the honeynet

## üéØ Objective  

The primary goal was to deploy intentionally vulnerable virtual machines within Azure to:  
1. Attract and analyze **cyber-attacks** for insights into attack techniques.  
2. Showcase rapid incident response capabilities.

## üñºÔ∏è Architecture  

### Before Hardening  
![Architecture Before](https://i.imgur.com/aBDwnKb.jpg)  

**Key Characteristics:**  
1. **Public Exposure**: All resources were openly accessible from the internet.  
2. **Minimal Restrictions**: NSGs and firewalls allowed unrestricted traffic.  
3. **Public Endpoints**: No private endpoints were configured.  

### After Hardening  
![Architecture After](https://i.imgur.com/YQNa9Pp.jpg)  

**Enhancements:**  
1. **Reinforced NSGs**: Strict access rules permitting only trusted IPs.  
2. **Improved Firewalls**: Fine-tuned configurations to reduce the attack surface.  
3. **Private Endpoints**: Sensitive resources were isolated from public access.

## üó∫Ô∏è Attack Maps  

### Before Hardening  
- **Unsecured NSG**: Malicious traffic flooded the environment.  
  ![Malicious Allowed](https://github.com/ibmancodin23/Azure-Honeynet-SOC-Project/assets/19808403/ec8ae96d-030f-4208-8eb8-ca9623d22b8c)  

- **Linux Server Attacks**: Syslog authentication failures detected.  
  ![Syslog Auth Fail](https://github.com/ibmancodin23/Azure-Honeynet-SOC-Project/assets/19808403/706314f4-38ca-45c1-ad0c-c787538231a8)  

- **Windows Server Attacks**: RDP and SMB authentication failures identified.  
  ![Windows Auth Fail](https://github.com/ibmancodin23/Azure-Honeynet-SOC-Project/assets/19808403/d5d6d41c-a4f9-47c3-bef4-7bf72d5e0d4e)  

### After Hardening  
**No malicious activity** was detected due to robust security measures.

## üìä Metrics Comparison  

| **Metric**                | **Before Hardening** | **After Hardening** |
|---------------------------|----------------------|---------------------|
| `SecurityEvent`           | 41,042              | 14,127             |
| `Syslog`                  | 5,439               | 290                |
| `SecurityAlert`           | 2                   | 0                  |
| `SecurityIncident`        | 219                 | 0                  |
| `AzureNetworkAnalytics_CL`| 412                 | 0                  |

## üèÅ Conclusion  

The project highlights the critical role of security controls in mitigating threats. By comparing pre- and post-hardening metrics, it is evident that:  
- Malicious activity was significantly reduced.  
- Implemented controls aligned with **NIST** standards improved overall security posture.  

This project showcases my ability to design, deploy, and secure Azure environments while effectively analyzing and mitigating cyber threats.
